<p>Localized efforts against gentrification in the South Bronx have flooded the area in the past month of October. Community leaders express real estate initiatives contribute to higher rents and evictions in the area. Data shows the South Bronx compared to the average of New York City  has an ongoing issue with rent burden in the past three years.</p>

<p>The rallies in October were not centered on any one individual, any one private-public green space, and not even one luxury development, it is about gentrification furthered by speculative real estate developers that hinder the affordability of the local's households.</p>

<p>“Not only can we not get affordable housing we cannot even stay in the house that we have in our neighborhoods. We have predatory landlords on our roofs”, says Mathew Shore lead organizer from the South Bronx Unite.</p>

<p>South Bronx Unite has been the leading non-profit organization organizing the rallies.They are part of the South Bronx's response to long-standing practices in Black, Brown, and immigrant communities where threats to existing affordable housing occur.</p>
